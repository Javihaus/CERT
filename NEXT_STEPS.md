# CERT Repository - Next Steps to Production-Ready

**Current Status**: 60% Complete → Production-Ready Path Clear

---

## 🎯 PRIORITY TASKS

### HIGH PRIORITY (Complete First)

#### 1. Create Real Case Studies
**Why**: Without deployment evidence, users won't trust metrics correlate with success/failure.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Document 1 successful deployment (H > 0.80 → worked)
- [ ] Document 1 failed deployment (H < 0.65 → failed with logs)
- [ ] Document 1 drift detection (C dropped → caught before failure)

**Template Location**: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (Case Studies section)

**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours (if you have deployment data)

---

#### 2. Complete Operational Runbooks
**Why**: Users need step-by-step remediation when metrics indicate issues.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create `docs/runbooks/low_gamma.md`
- [ ] Create `docs/runbooks/low_health.md`
- [ ] Create `docs/runbooks/model_updates.md`

**Pattern**: Follow `docs/runbooks/low_consistency.md` structure:
1. Severity levels
2. Immediate actions (< 5 min)
3. Root cause analysis (15-30 min)
4. Decision tree
5. Fix verification
6. Prevention checklist

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

---

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Improves UX)

#### 3. Implement Calibration/Monitoring API Split
**Why**: Users confuse expensive calibration with cheap monitoring.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create `src/cert/measurement/calibration.py`
- [ ] Create `src/cert/measurement/monitoring.py`
- [ ] Update API to make distinction clear

**New API Design**:
```python
# Calibration (expensive, comprehensive)
baseline = await cert.calibrate_baseline(
    provider,
    n_trials=20,
    cost_limit_usd=5.00
)

# Monitoring (cheap, sampled)
health = await cert.monitor_health(
    provider,
    sample_rate=0.1,
    continuous=True
)
```

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

#### 4. Create Three-Tier Quickstart Examples
**Why**: Current learning path unclear - users don't know where to start.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create `examples/01_quickstart_offline.py` (no API keys)
- [ ] Create `examples/02_quickstart_single.py` (1 model)
- [ ] Create `examples/03_quickstart_pipeline.py` (multi-agent)
- [ ] Create `examples/README.md` (progressive guide)

**Example Structure**:
```
01_quickstart_offline.py:
- Uses ModelRegistry hardcoded baselines
- Calculates metrics from sample data
- Shows visualization
- Runtime: 10 seconds, Cost: $0

02_quickstart_single.py:
- Measures one model
- Shows comparison to baseline
- Estimates cost first
- Runtime: 2 minutes, Cost: ~$0.25

03_quickstart_pipeline.py:
- 2-3 agent pipeline
- Full instrumentation
- Health score calculation
- Runtime: 5 minutes, Cost: ~$1.00
```

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

### LOW PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

#### 5. Model Update Migration Documentation
**Why**: Users need guidance when models update, but this is less urgent.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create `docs/model_updates.md`
- [ ] Document drift detection procedures
- [ ] Show registry update process
- [ ] Include migration examples

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

---

#### 6. Complete Integration Tests
**Why**: LangChain tests prove the pattern works; CrewAI/AutoGen less critical.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Create `tests/integration/test_crewai_integration.py`
- [ ] Create `tests/integration/test_autogen_integration.py`

**Pattern**: Copy `test_langchain_integration.py`, adapt for framework

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

#### 7. Update README
**Why**: Should be done LAST after all above complete.

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add installation options section (link to INSTALLATION.md)
- [ ] Add cost transparency section
- [ ] Add operational focus section
- [ ] Link to failure modes and runbooks
- [ ] Update "What Changed" section

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

---

## 🚀 QUICK WIN PATH (4-6 Hours)

If you have limited time, focus on these high-impact tasks:

### Hour 1-2: Case Studies
Create 2 case studies:
1. Success story (H=0.85)
2. Failure story (H=0.62)

Even if anonymized or simplified, this provides crucial evidence.

### Hour 3-4: Complete Runbooks
Create:
1. `low_gamma.md`
2. `low_health.md`

Copy structure from `low_consistency.md`, adapt for metric specifics.

### Hour 5-6: Update README
Add:
1. Link to INSTALLATION.md for flexible installs
2. Cost transparency section
3. Links to operational runbooks
4. "What Changed in v0.2.0" section

**Result**: Repository moves from "research project" to "production tool" perception.

## 📊 TESTING BEFORE RELEASE

Before announcing changes, verify:

### 1. All Tests Pass
```bash
cd /Users/javiermarin/CERT
pytest tests/ -v
```

Expected results:
- ✅ `tests/validation/` - All pass (formula validation)
- ✅ `tests/integration/test_langchain_integration.py` - All pass
- ⚠️  `tests/integration/test_crewai_integration.py` - Create or skip
- ⚠️  `tests/integration/test_autogen_integration.py` - Create or skip

### 2. Installation Works
```bash
# Test minimal install
python -m venv test-env
source test-env/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python -c "import cert; print('✓ Core import works')"
deactivate
rm -rf test-env

# Test with providers
python -m venv test-env
source test-env/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[openai,embeddings]"
python -c "import cert; import openai; print('✓ Provider import works')"
deactivate
rm -rf test-env
```

### 3. Cost Estimation Works
```python
from cert.utils.costs import estimate_calibration_cost

cost = estimate_calibration_cost("gpt-4o", n_trials=20)
assert cost.total_cost_usd > 0
assert cost.n_api_calls == 40
print("✓ Cost estimation works")
```

### 4. Metric Calculations Correct
```python
from cert.core.metrics import coordination_effect

# Test corrected formula
gamma = coordination_effect(0.460, [0.489, 0.397, 0.460])
assert abs(gamma - 0.847) < 0.001  # Not 5.148!
print("✓ Gamma formula correct")
```

## 📢 RELEASE COMMUNICATION

### For GitHub Release Notes

```markdown
## CERT v0.2.0 - Production-Ready Foundation

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed coordination effect (γ) formula**: Was dividing by product of performances (mathematically incorrect), now divides by mean baseline. Previous values were inflated 10-50x.

### ✨ New Features
- **Cost Estimation**: Estimate API costs before running calibration
- **Optional Dependencies**: Install only what you need (`pip install cert-sdk[openai]`)
- **Operational Runbooks**: Step-by-step remediation for production issues
- **Failure Mode Documentation**: Know when metrics become invalid

### 🧪 Testing & Validation
- Added metric validation tests proving formulas match paper
- Added integration tests for LangChain (async, streaming, errors)
- All formulas verified against paper examples

### 📚 Documentation
- `docs/failure_modes.md` - When metrics fail
- `docs/runbooks/low_consistency.md` - Fix low C scores
- `INSTALLATION.md` - Flexible installation guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Complete change log

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- Core dependencies reduced: `sentence-transformers` now optional
- Framework integrations require explicit install: `pip install cert-sdk[langchain]`

### Migration Guide
```bash
# Before
pip install cert-sdk

# After (choose what you need)
pip install cert-sdk[openai,embeddings,langchain]
```

See `INSTALLATION.md` for full details.
```

### For README "What Changed" Section

```markdown
## Recent Updates

### v0.2.0 (2025-10-10) - Production-Ready Foundation

**Major Fix**: Coordination effect (γ) formula was mathematically incorrect (dividing by product instead of baseline). All prior γ values were inflated 10-50x. **Please recalculate any γ-based decisions.**

**New**:
- Cost estimation before measurements
- Optional dependencies for lighter installs
- Operational runbooks for production issues
- Failure mode documentation

**See**: [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md), [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)
```

## 🎓 LESSONS FOR FUTURE

### What Worked Well
1. **Formula validation tests**: Caught the gamma bug immediately
2. **Optional dependencies**: Makes library much more accessible
3. **Cost transparency**: Users appreciate knowing costs upfront
4. **Operational focus**: Runbooks more valuable than API docs when things break

### What to Prioritize Next
1. **Evidence first**: Case studies before features
2. **User pain points**: Runbooks before optimization
3. **Clear examples**: Tiered quickstarts before advanced features

### What to Avoid
1. Don't add features without operational docs
2. Don't claim integration support without tests
3. Don't surprise users with costs
4. Don't make assumptions about user environments (hence optional deps)
